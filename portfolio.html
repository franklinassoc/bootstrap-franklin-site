                        <p class="card-text">The Foundation for Louisiana retained Franklin Associates to develop a comprehensive communications plan to promote <b>LA SAFE</b>—Louisiana’s Strategic Adaption for Future Environments—a six-parish planning initiative that is engaging citizens around the development of local resiliency strategies in the face of a changing coast line, increased flood risks and land loss.  Franklin developed all branding, including logo and web design, development of social media platforms, press relations and creation of LA SAFE-branded outreach materials to increase awareness of the effort and generate public participation in parishwide and community meetings. Franklin is also providing strategic communications counsel to the project, which is being undertaken in partnership with the Louisiana Office of Community Development/Disaster Recovery Unit. LA SAFE is one of the largest planning efforts of its type to ever be undertaken. The initiative provides coastal parish residents with information about the realities of land loss and flood risks in coming decades and then provides a forum for the development of citizen-developed plans to help communities successfully adapt to the changing coast.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">For thousands of our neighbors still struggling to recover from the devastating floods of 2016, the passage of time has not necessarily meant recovery. Working with the Louisiana Housing Corporation, Franklin organized meetings across the state to share information about the <b>Neighborhood Landlord Rental Program</b> and the <b>Multifamily Restoration Loan Fund</b>, two initiatives designed to speed recovery of affordable rental property.  The goals of both programs are to provide rental property owners—from small, “mom and pop” landlords to owners of larger multifamily properties—with the help they need so they can begin to rehabilitate their property’s and provide safe, decent and affordable housing. LHC staff and the Franklin team were on hand at two rounds of seminars and workshops in Baton Rouge, Hammond, Lafayette, Shreveport and Monroe and worked closely with LHC staff to develop presentation materials and generate interest in the program. With a short turnaround, Franklin delivered over 10,000 discrete email messages to stakeholders across Louisiana with program and meeting details as well as coordinating the development of media releases and advisories.<br>Franklin also administered the <b>Small Rental Property Program</b> for the Louisiana Housing Corporation, a lynchpin of Louisiana's response to the devastating storms of 2005 that ensured the return to affordable rental properties across South Louisiana.  As the lead on case management for the program, Franklin worked with closely with property owners across the state to ensure program compliance. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">As traffic issues continue to rise along the I-10 corridor in the Baton Rouge area, Louisiana’s Department of Transportation and Development has re-opened discussions within the community to seek solutions. A feasibility study conducted in 2015-2016 feasibility study was the first step in examining improvements to the area of I-10 between the Mississippi River Bridge and the I-10/I-12 split and engaging the public. The second step is the Stage 1 Planning and Environmental study, which is evaluating the alternatives accepted to move forward from the feasibility study. The environmental study will help determine social, economic, and environmental impacts of the alternatives. The DOTD will continue to engage the public throughout the process with informational meetings that will offer an opportunity to ask questions and provide comments. On this project, Franklin is coordinating public outreach to ensure residents and business owners have the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the design process.  From neighborhood canvassing, public meeting coordination and facilitation and providing content through the projects social media sites, Franklin’s work build on our extensive experience in transportation planning and community outreach.</p>
